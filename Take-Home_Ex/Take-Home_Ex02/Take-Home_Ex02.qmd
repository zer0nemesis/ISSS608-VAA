# Background

In this take home exercise, we will:

-   select one of the Take-home Exercise 1 prepared by my classmate, [Freddie Jr. Ngo Tan](https://isss608-ay2023-24t2-ftj72.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01/take-home_ex01#insights)

-   critic the submission in terms of clarity and aesthetics,

-   prepare a sketch for the alternative design by using the data visualisation design principles and best practices we had learned in Lesson 1 and 2, and

-   remake the original design by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.

## Recap of Take Home Exercise 01

The aim of Take Home Exercise 01 was to use appropriate **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** methods and **ggplot2** functions to reveal:

-   the distribution of Singapore students’ performance in mathematics, reading, and science, and

-   the relationship between these performances with schools, gender and socioeconomic status of the students.

The dataset used was extracted from the "[PISA 2022 database](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/)" which contains the full set of responses from individual students.

# Data Preparation

## Loading R Packages

In this take-home exercise, eleven R packages will be used. They are:

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/),

-   [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/),

-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/),

-   [ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/),

-   [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/),

-   [ggthemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/),

-   [hrbrthemes](https://cinc.rud.is/web/packages/hrbrthemes/),

-   [ggdist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdist/index.html),

-   [ggridges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/index.html),

-   [colorspace](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/articles/colorspace.html), and

-   [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html).

The code chunk used is as follows:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggplot2, ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, ggdist, ggridges, colorspace, gridExtra,cowplot)
```

## Importing PISA 2022 Data

The code chunk below uses the [read_sas](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) function from the haven package to import PISA data into R.

```{r}
#| eval: false 

stu_qqq <- read_sas("data/stu_qqq.sas7bdat")
```

We will next filter the observations to those from Singapore, using the [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) function from the dpylr package.

```{r}
#| eval: false 

stu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq %>%
  filter(CNT == "SGP")
```

We will then save the file as a rds document in the data folder, using [write_rds](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) function. This reduces the file size from 3.9GB to 65.3MB, which makes it easier to push to Github subsequently.

```{r}
#| eval: false 

write_rds(stu_qqq_SG, "data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

We will now import the file back into the R enviroment using the [read_rds](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) function.

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

::: callout-warning
Remember to:

-   delete the 3.9GB source file from the data folder; and

-   include "#\| eval: false" into the first three code chunks of this section.

# Critique in terms of Clarity and Aesthetics

## Distribution of Students’ Performance

The first requirement for Take-Home_Ex02 was to show the distribution of Singapore students’ performance in mathematics, reading, and science. Freddie made use of boxplots to illustrate the distribution of the scores as shown below. The boxplots for each of the subjects were segregated into different tabs, and the code chunk was "hidden" from the audience's view unless the user clicks on "Show the code".

![](images/clipboard-406550956.png)

### Positive Areas

The three box plots were clear and simple. It gave me (as audience) a clear view of the min-max distribution, interquartile range, median and outliers.

### Areas for Improvement

It was difficult for me to comprehend what analysis the graphs were trying to tell me. I thought that adding a histogram to supplement the boxplot may be able to tell the audience what the distributions look like. In addition, there are merits to combining all three graphs together on the same panel, so that the audience can have an overview at one glance, instead of having to navigate the different tabs to compare the similarity/differences between the three subjects.

### Re-Modelled Distribution

::: callout-tip
Do align the x-axis of both histograms and boxplots so that the distributions are mapped correctly.
