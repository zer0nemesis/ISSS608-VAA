    "text": "OECD education director Andreas Schleicher shared in a BBC article that “Singapore managed to achieve excellence without wide differences between children from wealthy and disadvantaged families.” (2016) Furthermore, several Singapore’s Minister for Education also started an “every school a good school” slogan. The general public, however, strongly belief that there are still disparities that exist, especially between the elite schools and neighborhood school, between students from families with higher socioeconomic status and those with relatively lower socioeconomic status and immigration and non-immigration families."

In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

Thereafter, on the pop-out box, you can select the various options for “Scope”, “Line” and “Formatting”.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what the per pane for “Scope” looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also customise your own reference line by selecting “custom” under “Line/ Label”, and typing in “Avg = &lt;Value&gt;”.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Adjusting Graph Lines\nUnder the Marks panel, you can select the “Colour” and “Size” for the graph lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Incorporating Dual Axis Plot\nWe will demostrate how to incorporate a dual axis plot. First, we drag the “Profits” into the Rows. Notice that graphs for the profits will created in each output pane. Next, we will hover around the profit y-axis, right-click, and select “Dual Axis”.\n\n\nFrom the graph below, we notice that the scales for “Sum(Sales)” and “Sum(Profits)” are not synchronised. It may be difficult for readers to notice the different scales at first glance. Thus we will synchonise the axis by simplying hovering around the “Profit” y-axis, right-click and select “Synchronise Axis”.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Editing Graph Colours from Ranged to Bi-Polar\nFirst, we will change the graph type of “Profits” from line to bar. Next, we will drag “Sum(Profits)” over to “Color” under the “Marks” panel, selecting 2 for “Stepped Color”.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Formatting Axis Titles\nWe observe that the x-axis titles are being cut off, resulting in the first letter being displayed, and the remaining letters reflected as “…”. To overcome this, simply hover over “Month” in columns, right-click and select “Format”. From the “Format” panel that popped out, select how you want the dates to be reflected on the axis."

In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.
