Probability Density Plot

Axis values: instead of density for y-axis, should be probability

observing the PDF and comment the skewness of the three curves

when the values are categorical, and "as.factor" is not used, the output will display a scatterplot instead of a boxplot

sort by mean or median (my graph), to identify patterns

-   can also plot by boxplots

for scatterplot, need to pay attention on the aspect ratio. should try to fit within a square as much as possible, otherwise output will be skewed

layout - one histogram should not be larger than the other

-   but can be histogram on the left, then 3 x similarly sized boxplots on the right (with the same aspect and scale)

Try to reduce redundancy in the output
