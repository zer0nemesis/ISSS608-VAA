# 1. Learning Outcome

This chapter aims to share on data manipulation using tidyverse, haven, read_rds and write_rds.

# 2. Getting Started

## 2.1 Loading R Packages

In this in-class exercise, two R packages will be used. They are:

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and

-   [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/).

The code chunk used is as follows:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven)
```

## 2.2 Importing PISA Data

The code chunk below uses the [read_sas](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) function from the haven package to import PISA data into R.

```{r}
#| eval: false
stu_qqq <- read_sas("data/stu_qqq.sas7bdat")
```

As there are 613,744 observations across many countries, we will next filter the observations to those from Singapore, using the [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) function from the dpylr package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
stu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq %>%
  filter(CNT == "SGP")
```

We will then save the file as a rds document in the data folder, using [write_rds](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) function. This reduced the file size from 3.9GB to 65.3MB, which will make it easier to push to Github subsequently.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(stu_qqq_SG, 
          "data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

We will now import the file back into the R enviroment using the [read_rds](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) function.

```{r}
stu_qqq <- read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

***Note:*** Remember to:

-   delete the 3.9GB source file from the data folder

-   include #\| eval: false into the first three code chunks, to faciliate the subsequent push to Github.
