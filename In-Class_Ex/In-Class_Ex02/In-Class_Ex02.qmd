# Learning Outcome

An introduction on using Tableau to visualise data, and publish it on the website. You can access In-Class_Ex02 Tableau webpage [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger.chen4630/viz/In-Class_Ex02/MonthlySalesandProfitbyRegion2016-2019?publish=yes).

# Getting Started

## Importing the data

There are two ways to import the data. You can either drag the data source file into Tableau Window directly, or clicking on "file/ open/ data"

## Viewing the Data

We can see that there are three sheets to choose from, which corresponds with the sheets in the data source file. We will first drag "*Orders*" into the main window.

After that is done, there will be two tables being displayed, as shown below. On the left are the descriptors for the fields, while the right displays the observations.

## Establishing Relationships between Sheets

To establish a relationships between sheets, simply link them by dragging the sheets into the top window.

# Exploring Tableau Functions

On the bottom left corner, there are three tabs denoting "New Worksheet", "New Dashboard" and "New Story". We will first explore the functions using the sheet.

## Tables

### Creating Tables

To create a table, first drag "Region" into the *Columns* and "Year" into *Rows*. After which, just drag "Sales" into the table itself, as follows:

### Computing Totals

To compute total, simply go over to the "Analytics Panel", click on "Totals" and drag it over to either "Column Grand Totals", "Row Grand Totals" or both.

## Graphs

First, you can create a graph by dragging the following variables into the *rows* and *columns*.

### Adding Reference Line

To add a reference line, simply hover around the y-axis, right click and select "Add Reference Line". Thereafter, on the pop-out box, you can select the various options for "Scope", "Line" and "Formatting".

This is what the per pane for "Scope" looks like:

You can also customise your own reference line by selecting "custom" under "Line/ Label", and typing in "Avg = \<Value\>".

### Adjusting Graph Lines

Under the *Marks* panel, you can select the "Colour" and "Size" for the graph lines.

### Incorporating Dual Axis Plot

We will demostrate how to incorporate a dual axis plot. First, we drag the "Profits" into the *Rows*. Notice that graphs for the profits will created in each output pane. Next, we will hover around the profit y-axis, right-click, and select "Dual Axis".

\

From the graph below, we notice that the scales for "Sum(Sales)" and "Sum(Profits)" are not synchronised. It may be difficult for readers to notice the different scales at first glance. Thus we will synchonise the axis by simplying hovering around the "Profit" y-axis, right-click and select "Synchronise Axis".

### Editing Graph Colours from Ranged to Bi-Polar

First, we will change the graph type of "Profits" from *line* to *bar*. Next, we will drag "Sum(Profits)" over to "Color" under the "Marks" panel, selecting 2 for "Stepped Color".

![](images/clipboard-1428876796.png)

### Formatting Axis Titles

We observe that the x-axis titles are being cut off, resulting in the first letter being displayed, and the remaining letters reflected as "...". To overcome this, simply hover over "Month" in *columns*, right-click and select "Format". From the "Format" panel that popped out, select how you want the dates to be reflected on the axis.

# Copying Graph Images to PPT

There will be instances when bosses demand data visualisation on powerpoint slides. To achieve this, simply hover over the graph, right-click, select "Copy" and choose the different options of copying.

# Saving to Tableau Public

To publish your work to Tableau Public, simply go to "Server/ Tableau Public/ Save to Tableau Public". Before that, remember to rename your worksheets and saving your file as a "Tableau Extract" file.
