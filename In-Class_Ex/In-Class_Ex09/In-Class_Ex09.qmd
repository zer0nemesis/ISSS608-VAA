# Overview

In this in-class exercise, we will learn how to use Tableau to create:

-   Bullet Graph,

-   Sparkline,

-   Dashboard

You can access the Tableau webpage [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger.chen4630/viz/In-Class_Ex09_17111734483180/In-Class_Ex09?publish=yes).

# Creating Bullet Graph

First, to create a bullet graph, we will select the parameters "Budget Sales", "Market" and "Product Type" and select "Bullet Graph" in *Show Me*.

Next, we will swap the reference line fields.

# Creating Sparkline

For the Column field, we will select Date, and change from Year to Month.

For the Row field, we will select "Market", "Product Type" and "Sales".

Next, we will select independent axes for each row and column.

For easier viewing, we will adjust the margins so that we can fit all the graphs within one page.

![Next, we will make use of the "Create Calculated Field) to display the min and max point.](images/clipboard-606467558.png)

The code is as follows:

We will select the high-low point and insert it as our secondary y-axis.

We will change the shape to Circle, and synchronise both Y-axes.

We will also hide the indicator that is displayed on the bottom of the graph.

Next, to differentiate the min and max points by colours, we will create a calculated field for Low-High Colour. The code is as follows:

We will now drag high-low colour to the graph, and change the colour for low and high points to red and blue respectively.

As the graph is now too cluttered by different colours, we will change the colour of the base graph to grey.

Next, to display the values of the min and max values, we will create another calculated field for the high-low labels. The code is as follows:

![](images/clipboard-588697963.png)

We will add the labels to the graph.

# Creating Dashboard

Next, we will create the dashboard which incorporates both the Bullet Graph (Annual Sales) and the Sparkline (Monthly Sales).

We will add a blank panel below Sparkline so that we can synchronise the borders. We will also synchronise to one single date filter.

Lastly, we will extract the data before publishing on Tableau Public.
